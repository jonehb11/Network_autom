AWS IP Range Finder

This script allows users to search for AWS IP ranges based on a provided IP address or an AWS service.
Description

    If an IP address is provided, the script checks if the IP falls within any of the AWS subnets listed in the ip-ranges.json file and displays the matching range entry.
    If the user presses Enter without providing an IP, the script lists all available AWS services from which the user can select. It then displays all the IP ranges associated with the chosen AWS service.
